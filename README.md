# Final_Project - Working Women

## Proposal 
The aim of this project is to see if it is possible to accurately predict if a women will return to work after having a baby. I aim to create a website for anxious employees, where they can answer a short questionaire about whether their hard working empolyee will return to work. I have put together a short, 10 question survey sent to mothers across several platforms. I will run a logistically regression on this data to determine if we can predict a womens return to work.   While this dataset will be small and involve women located predominately in Western Australia, it is a starting block. I aim to include globally collected data regarding mothers in the workforce for reference and comparison.
