# Final_Project - Working Women

## Proposal 
The aim of this project is to see if it is possible to accurately predict if a women will return to work after having a baby. I aim to create a website for anxious employers, where they can answer a short questionaire about whether their hard working empolyee will return to work. With results from a short, 10 question survey sent to mothers across several platforms I will run a logistically regression on collected data to determine if it is possible to predict a womens return to work.   While this dataset will be small and involve women located predominately in Perth, Western Australia, it is a starting block. I aim to include globally collected data regarding mothers in the workforce for reference and comparison and interest.
